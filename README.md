# Elixir_MadLibs
# This is my pretty rubbish first Elixir program!
1. To run, please clone the repo
2. Navigate to the madlibs/ directory
3. Assuming you have Elixir already installed, you can now do the following:
4. Open up the project in iex with this command:
```iex -S mix```
5. Then to run the game:
```iex> MADLIBS.MadLibs.play_madlibs```
6. Enter your values for the grammatical terms with a comma separating each one. 
7. Hit the 'return' or 'enter' key
8. Roll around laughing at the funny sentence that you made!  lol


## Caveats:
1. No validation of user entered values
2. No recursive game loop so it only plays one round
